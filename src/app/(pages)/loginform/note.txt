useState is used to show the initial state and upcomimg changing states of the objects.

async(e) ->here,'e' is the event occurs 
and e.preventdefault is used to save the event message on the console to check the messge. 

A function can be made async by using async keyword:
for example:-async function harry() {
   return 6;
}
  harry.then((x)=>{
    alert(x)
  })

we can make any function aync and then make promise await.
-> An async function always ensures that it returns a promise.
we use .then in aync function becoz it returns promise.
